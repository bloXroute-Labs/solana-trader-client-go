# Serum API Benchmark Scripts

This folder contains a series of scripts that can be run for the purposes of benchmarking various aspects relevant
to the functioning of Serum API.

## Scripts List
 - `serumapi`: Compares performance of Serum API against fetching data directly from a reference Solana node.
 - `txcompare`: Compares submitting competing transactions to multiple Solana nodes to determine if one is consistently faster.

You can read through the `main.go` files for more information.
